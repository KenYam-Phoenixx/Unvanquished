    "Building a structure requires build points, which are now a one-time "
    "payment – if the buildable gets destroyed, the build points spent on it "

    "efficiency.\n"

    " which represents its efficiency. A prediction will be shown when you "
    "position the buildable.\n"

    " go back down a stage – you will lose access to anything new of whatever "
    "the lost stage(s) provided, but existing upgrades will remain "
    "functional.\n"

    "The [reactor] reactor now supplies power to every point on the map, but "
    "there is a limited amount of energy per region. Human buildables will "
    "compete for power and shut down if they don't get enough.\n"
    "\n"
    "Human builders will see a new bar below the health bar of their "
    "buildables, which shows the spare power a buildable can share with "
    "potential neighbors.\n"
    "\n"
    "If you want to place a greater number of buildables in an area, you can "
    "build a [repeater] repeater to increase the available power. "

    "The [drill] drill is the only buildable that requires a close repeater or "
    "reactor to work, since resources are transmitted via the power grid.\n"
