    "In this section you will find a summary of major changes since Tremulous 1.1. It is "
    "not a complete list. In general, all things have been tweaked for balance in "
    "some way.\n\n"
    "We hope you enjoy playing. Your support gives us valuable data and "
    "feedback as we work to bring you Unvanquished 1.0. Please report all bugs. Thank "
    "you."
  }
  "Alien Healing"
  {
    "The most important change for Alien players to know is that their healing "
    "rate is slower away from creep. To counter this, healing near [booster] Boosters "
    "and [basilisk] Basilisks is greatly accelerated.\n\n"
    "Watch the health cross icon on your "
    "HUD to see what your healing rate is. If the icon glows, you are on "
    "creep. If you are near a booster or basilisk, you will see two "
    "(2× healing) or four (3× healing) barbs around the health cross."
  }
  "Build-point Changes"
  {
    "Structures destroyed by enemy players will not immediately become available "
    "for reuse, but instead enter a queue. Build points will gradually leave the "
    "queue to become available again, at a rate proportional to the amount of "
    "points in the queue.\n\n"
    "[repeater] Repeaters can be built at any stage and come with 20 "
    "BP that can only be used nearby to facilitate making small outposts. Aliens "
    "do not have a structure that provides additional buildpoints, but they have 150 "
    "overall BP to compensate."
  }
  "Marked Deconstruction"
  {
    "The deconstruction method has changed. Buildables are no longer instantly "
    "deconstructed. Instead, a deconstruct mark appears on the health bar. "
    "Build somewhere else and the old one will be removed automatically if its build points are needed. "
    "Buildables that are about to be removed by constructing the selected buildable glow ^1red^7."
    "\n\n"
    "Depending on server configuration, it may be possible to deconstruct "
    "some marked buildings."
  }
  "Alien Buildables"
  {
    "Nearly useless in 1.1, [barricade] Barricades now have more health, are cheaper to "
    "build, and will shrink to allow Aliens to pass over them. [acidtube] Acid tubes "
    "will fire from behind barricades, providing a formidable defense. "
    "Experiment with blocking off hallways and building staged defenses, but "
    "keep in mind that low ceilings will prevent [tyrant] Tyrants from returning inside "
    "the base. Hives are also much improved to become worth building in stage 3."
  }
  "Human Buildables"
  {
    "[turret] Turrets now have a small spin up delay before firing, but they have "
    "increased range and damage output.\n\n"
    "To protect against small Aliens getting inside "
    "the base, build [tesla] Tesla Generators at Stage 3. Tesla Generators no longer "
    "require the [defcomp] Defence Computer to function. Instead, the Defence Computer "
    "will automatically repair Human buildables. Tesla Generators can fire "
    "over turrets."
  }
  "Human Weapons"
  {
    "Most projectiles have a small volume now, making them more "
    "effective against smaller targets.\n\n"
    "The [lcannon] Lucifer Cannon projectile can be fired faster but now takes longer "
    "to charge. Overcharging is audible to team-mates. "
    "Luci balls and [prifle] pulse rifle shots may lose power as they travel.\n\n"
    "The [flamer] Flamer projectile now gains more of the velocity of its wielder, "
    "making it easier to chase down aliens without toasting yourself too. "
    "It does less damage on impact; however, it causes heat damage "
    "to nearby buildings or players while in flight."
  }
  "Lag Correction"
  {
    "While the Unvanquished implementation of Neil Toronto's unlagged has "
    "become widely accepted in Tremulous GPP, we also implement client-side "
    "improvements not possible in 1.1 servers. "
    "For those who insist on leading their "
    "attacks, setting cg_unlagged to 0 will disable backward reconcilliation "
    "on your hitscan weapons."
  }
  "Sprint"
  {
    "The sprint bind has changed from “^5boost^7” to “^5+sprint^7”; you can bind it "
    "in the options menu or in the console (^5\\bind shift +sprint^7). Now, instead "
    "of tapping the button while moving to start sprinting, just hold it down "
    "and let go to stop. Alternatively, you can change this to a toggle behavior "
    "with cg_sprintToggle."
  }
  "Dodge"
  {
    "Humans also have a new movement ability: dodge. However, "
    "it has a 5-second cooldown between each use. You can bind it in the "
    "options menu or the console (^5\\bind shift +sprint^7). When strafing or "
    "walking backwards, press the dodge key to make a quick, low jump. You "
    "can bind this to the same key as sprint in the console with ^5\\bind shift "
    "\"+sprint; +dodge\"^7."
  }
  "Headshots"
  {
    "Headshots on unarmoured humans only cause 150% damage. Battlesuit and "
    "helmet protection have been reduced so headshot damage remains the same."
  }
  "Radar"
  {
    "Players who remain motionless will become invisible to human radar and "
    "alien proximity sense."
  }
  "[dretch] Dretch"
  {
    "Dretches are slightly faster and can now damage any human structure while it "
    "is still building, but can no longer damage turrets and teslas that "
    "have been completed."
  }
  "[basilisk] Basilisk"
  {
    "Basilisks provide regeneration boosting auras to nearby teammates: 2× "
    "from regular and 3× from [advbasilisk] advanced basilisks. Their footsteps are also "
    "silent for greater stealth."
  }
  "[marauder] Marauder"
  {
    "The [advmarauder] Adv. Marauder's electric shock damage is no longer split between its "
    "targets, making it more effective against large groups of humans and "
    "buildables. Targets are now chosen slightly differently: instead of "
    "each new chain section originating from the previous target, it will "
    "originate from the first target."
  }
  "[dragoon] Dragoon"
  {
    "[advdragoon] Advanced dragoons are now available at stage 2. Both dragoons have the "
    "range of their chomp attacks lowered, but their pounce attacks are much "
    "more useful. Try to use pounce to pin a human to the wall before chomping."
  }
  "[tyrant] Tyrant"
  {
    "The Tyrant is now a weaker class as its health has been lowered and "
    "turret damage is greater. To counter this, Tyrants can charge for longer "
    "periods of time, hit targets multiple times in a single charge, "
    "and crush any Humans they land on top of. Trample charge does not "
    "instantly release when full but can be held for two seconds. Trample "
    "attacks on a human pinned against a wall are VERY powerful. Use this to "
    "your advantage. The Tyrant's healing aura has been removed; find a "
    "booster or a basilisk to heal faster."
  }
}
